## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL based hue of soft teal, close to green, a desaturated shade, representing trustworthiness and support (#8FBC8F).
- Background color: A desaturated pastel version of the primary, creating a calm, unobtrusive canvas (#F0F8F0).
- Accent color: A slightly more saturated blue-green analogous to the primary hue, to draw attention to actionable elements (#70A1AF).
- Body text: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) offers a clean and modern look for general text.
